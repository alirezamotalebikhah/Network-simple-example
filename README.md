# Network Simple Examples

This repository contains a set of simple network simulations created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The examples demonstrate basic concepts such as IP address assignment, routing, and connectivity between different network devices including routers, switches, and PCs.

## Purpose

These simulations were completed as part of the **Data Engineer Bootcamp** at **Hamrah Aval Academy**. The project aims to provide practical, hands-on examples for understanding foundational networking concepts in a simulated environment.

## Features

- Simple IP address configuration for network devices
- Basic router and switch setup
- Network connectivity testing and troubleshooting
- Examples suitable for beginners to learn Cisco Packet Tracer basics

## Requirements

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (any version compatible with the provided simulation files)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addressing, routing, switching)

## Usage

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Load the simulation file(s) from this repository.
3. Follow the network configuration examples and test connectivity between devices.
